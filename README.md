# Job-Finder
The project uses a database approach to store and retrieve data. All this is made possible through implementing through a web interface. Using a web interface makes it possible to provide accessibility and scalability for large number of users. It also provides an abstraction layer over the database and hence simplifies the complexity created by the database and an easy access interface to the user. Our project uses MYSQL as a DBMS andPHP as server sided scripting language to handle the database queries from the user. The UI design is implemented through HTML, CSS and JS.
